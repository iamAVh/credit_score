This project focuses on building a decentralized credit scoring system using wallet-level DeFi transaction data. The goal was to assign synthetic credit scores to user wallets based solely on on-chain behaviors like deposits, borrows, repayments, and redemptions. Initially, I started with a raw `user_transactions.json` file and extracted wallet-level summaries by grouping transactions by `userWallet`, calculating transaction counts, estimating USD values per action using token amount and asset prices, and computing active duration based on timestamps. This structured data was stored in `wallet_summary.csv`, which provided a clean format for modeling. To begin modeling, I first used a Random Forest Regressor to predict credit scores based on engineered features like repayment-to-borrow ratio, redeem-to-deposit ratio, and activity days. However, the Random Forest model gave a relatively high MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of around 13, which indicated poor predictive performance and pushed me to explore better alternatives. I then switched to XGBoost, which brought down the MAE to 11.3. Even then, the score logic wasn't ideal—wallets that only deposited without borrowing were getting low scores, while those who borrowed large amounts and barely repaid were scoring high, which didn’t align with real-world creditworthiness expectations.

To fix this, I redesigned the synthetic credit score formula to better reflect logical financial behavior. I started rewarding wallets that had deposits, giving them a 0.4 weight; added 0.2 weight for high repayment ratios; included a 0.15 weight for active participation (via active days); and added 0.1 weight for redeeming. Importantly, I introduced penalties: -0.1 if a wallet borrowed but didn’t repay at all, and -0.05 if it borrowed but repaid less than half. This updated formula brought a much more realistic scoring pattern. After implementing this change, I retrained the XGBoost model, which then gave a significantly improved MAE of \~3.0, meaning the predictions closely matched the intended credit score logic. I also wrote a script to randomly sample and print wallet-level score breakdowns to verify that scores aligned with wallet behavior—wallets that only deposited were now correctly scoring high, while wallets with large unrepaid borrowings were penalized.

In addition to training the model, I built tools to analyze and inspect wallet behavior over time and estimate USD activity across actions like `deposit`, `borrow`, `repay`, and `redeemUnderlying`. These tools were essential in validating whether the model treated each wallet fairly and meaningfully. Finally, I outlined a future plan for how this credit scoring system could be used in real-world DeFi applications: wallets with scores below 400 could be classified as "high risk" and denied loans, while those in the medium or high range could receive loans of increasing flexibility. For high-risk users, I proposed building an educational + challenge-based system where users could improve their creditworthiness by completing specific financial behavior goals—like consistent deposits, timely repayments, or challenge completions—thereby increasing their synthetic credit score over time. Overall, this project evolved from raw transaction logs to a full-fledged, interpretable, and logic-aligned machine learning pipeline using XGBoost, and shows strong potential for on-chain risk classification and user-centric DeFi scoring systems.
